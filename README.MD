# Java exercise 2 - Geometry with OOP
Second project done during OOP workshops in Codecool. The goal was to get familiar with inheritance concept and abstract classes in Java.

## General info
The Geometry program allows user to add new shapes to the list, calculate their area and perimeter and seek for biggest shapes. User can print their shapes in the form of table:

User has a clear menu presented to them. With basic input validation, most UX activities are made foolproof.
